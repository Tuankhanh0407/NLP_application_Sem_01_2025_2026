Spark NLP Pipeline Implementation Report

1. Implementation Steps:

1.1 Project Overview:
This project implements a complete Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline using Apache Spark and PySpark. The pipeline processes text data from the C4 dataset through multiple stages including tokenization, stop words removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.

1.2 Architecture Design:
The implementation follows a modular object-oriented design with the following key components:

Core Classes:
- SparkSessionManager: Handles Spark session creation and configuration
- DataLoader: Manages data loading from JSON files
- NLPPipelineBuilder: Constructs the ML pipeline stages
- ResultSaver: Handles output persistence
- LoggerSetup: Configures logging infrastructure
- PipelineExecutor: Coordinates the entire workflow

1.3 Pipeline Stages Implementation:

Stage 1: Data Loading
python
# Load compressed JSON data with schema definition
schema = StructType([
    StructField("text", StringType(), True),
    StructField("url", StringType(), True),
    StructField("timestamp", StringType(), True)
])
dataframe = spark_session.read.json(file_path, schema=schema)

Stage 2: Tokenization
- Used RegexTokenizer with pattern \\W+ to split text on non-word characters.
- Minimum token length set to 2 characters to filter out very short tokens.
- Configured to identify gaps between words rather than matching tokens.

Stage 3: Stop Words Removal
- Employed StopWordsRemover with default English stop words list.
- Filters out common words like "the", "a", "is" that carry little semantic meaning.
- Reduces feature space dimensionality and computational complexity.

Stage 4: TF-IDF Vectorization
- HashingTF: Converts tokens to term frequency vectors using feature hashing. 
- numFeatures set to 20,000 for adequate feature representation.
- IDF: Calculates inverse document frequency to weight term importance.
- Outputs sparse vectors representing document features.

1.4 Result Persistence:
- Results saved in JSON format with GZIP compression.
- Output includes original text, tokens, filtered words, and feature vectors.
- Automatic directory creation for output paths.
